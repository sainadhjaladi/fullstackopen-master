## GraphQL frontend

Through the exercises, we will implement a GraphQL frontend for the GraphQL-library created previously.


### Start the application locally
First, you need to start the backend from the previous exercise. To do so, head to the `part8/library-backend` directory and follow the instructions from the README.


Then, start the frontend:
```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# Start the application
$ npm start
```

You can then access the app on: http://localhost:3000/.
