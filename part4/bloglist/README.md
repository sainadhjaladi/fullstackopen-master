# Blog list

In this part we will be building a blog list application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, url, and amount of upvotes from users of the application.

## Start the application locally

To start an application:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# create a .env file and put there the MONGODB_URI for connecting to your mongodb database
$ echo "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" > .env
$ echo "TEST_MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-TEST-MONGODB-URI>" > .env
$ echo "DEV_MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-DEV-MONGODB-URI>" > .env

# Set a variable SECRET which is a digital signature ensures that only parties who know the secret can generate a valid token.
$ echo "SECRET=yoursecretphrase" > .env

# Start the application in dev environment
$ npm run dev

# Start the application in prod environment
$ npm start

# # Start the application in test environment and run tests
$ run start:test
$ npm test
```

Once successfully connected, the app allows you to perform the following operations:
* Create & List `Users` (POST, GET)
* Login using username and password (POST)
* Create, List, Update & Delete `Blogs` (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for an authenticated user

Those operations are possible using REST APIs on the following enpoints (add /ID for PUT & DELETE):
* http://localhost:3001/api/login
* http://localhost:3001/api/users
* http://localhost:3001/api/blogs


```json
# To create a new user
POST /api/users
{
    "username": "toto",
    "name": "toto",
    "password": "toto"
}
# To login. Once logged in, a jwt token is sent back to the user.
POST /api/login
{
    "username": "toto",
    "password": "toto"
}
# To create a new Blog (Using JWT token)
POST /api/blogs - {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR-JWT-TOKEN"}
