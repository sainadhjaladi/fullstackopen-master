# Ultimate hooks

In this exercise, we are refactoring [this app](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/ultimate-hooks) using custom hooks. This app displays notes and phone numbers fetched from a backend server.

However, we noticed that the same code responsible for fetching notes from the backend could be reused in the blog post application. Indeed, only the `baseUrl` differs. As a result, we extracted the code for communicating with a backend server into its own `useResource` hook.

## Start the application

To start an application, do the following :

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install
# Start the JSON Server
$ npm run server
# On another terminal, start the application
$ npm start
```

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:3000/

You can also see the content of the JSON Server by heading to:
* http://localhost:3005/notes
* http://localhost:3005/persons
