# Phonebook API

In this exercise, we implemented a fullstack phonebook app with a backend written in Node.js and a frontend in react.js. The data are saved in a mongodb database and the app is deployed on heroku at the folowing URL.

* https://peaceful-depths-89341.herokuapp.com/

## Start the application locally

To start an application:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# create a .env file and put there the MONGODB_URI for connecting to your mongodb database
$ echo "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" > .env

# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:3001/
